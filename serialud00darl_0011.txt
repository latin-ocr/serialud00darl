PREFACE

Many of these trifles appeared long ago in
the St. James’s Gazette, and are now republished
with ‘che kind permission of the Proprietors of
that journal.

If their resurrection requires some apology‚
1 can only say that 1 believe no midge ever
fluttered for an hour in ‘che sunlight but he
would dance again if he could.
