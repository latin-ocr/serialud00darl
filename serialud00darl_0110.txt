the body3 but after, O'Noy porte demeumd for a writ
habeas corpus sor the delivery to him of the body of
the said landlord.

Le Poma—And so debate was had whether O’N oy
or Bryan O’Linn should have the said lord, i.e. corpus
quod dominus fuit.

Pom· Ie PI.—Twist of Counsel ροιιι· Ie ΡΙ. O'Noy
—Juste est que Ie ΡΙ. tecouvrem.

And first, a landlord is either a beast, fetae
naturae, 01· vermin. Εη cas that he is a beast, ferae
naturae, he belongeth‚ when slain, to him on whose
land he fall, ratIone soli, because of the interest in
such land.

2. The right of a tenant under Lex Pet-nemone
extendeth only to the killing of his landlord; and
giveth no right to the body, or personal effects, of
him (corpus ejus, aut catalla) unless he fall on the
proper land of the tenant.

3. If—as seemeth most fit—a landlord be held to
be not game at all, but vermin merely; then is there
no property of such things-and O’Noy may retake
the landlord if and when he can.

Ροιιι· Ie Defend.—Quirk of Counsel—Semble que
non.

1. That a landlord is a beast is allowed; but moy
semble, he is “ground game'' ; and mark, ρουι· quoi
he is not protected by the Parliament. And so the
tenant shall have him for the hunting.

2. En outre—If the landlord had been started
on the land of O'Noy, peradventure a! contrary.
But he was started on the holding of another,
and after did run on to the land of Ie ΡΙ., and did
there fall, and so le Defend. may of right retake his

quarry. 86
