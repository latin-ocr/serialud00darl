But wherefore bid a neighbour look
To serpents for instruction3

Why join to viper's tongue the mien
Of doves that live by suction Ρ

Why mention that “the dust of blame ”
On Russian robes will settle,

If English husbandmen shall come
To grasp the Afghan nettle ?

Loves he, the Czar, such weeds to plant,
To cherish, and to tend ’em ;

To watch their growth in others' fields;
And, where they spread, defend ’em ? ·

What means this promise, too, of troops ?
Does etiquette of nations

Require brigades to carry cards
Of mere felicitations?

Ι sear me not. Yet sage Argyll
These visits sees with gladneSS,
Scouts lack of saith in Muscovites
As “Mervousness’' and “madness.''
