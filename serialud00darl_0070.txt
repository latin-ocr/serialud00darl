To A MILITARY cmm

Lord Cardwell's army takes the field; and you
Who hold them all too young to leave their home,
O'er icy crags or burning wastes to roam,

Of me demand how these thin ranks, so new

To arms, again the valiant deeds may do

Of sires who led the Normen o'er the foam,

Broke their poor spears against the ranks of Rome,
Or conquered France with stubborn staves of yew.
Indeed you say these soldiers infants are,

Whom not with civil rights we yet endow ;

Unfit, therefore, through foreign wars‘ alarms

To drive or follow dread Bellona‘s car.

Bethink you yet one moment, and allow

They’re sasest, since they infants are, in arms.
