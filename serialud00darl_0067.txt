before now, remaining confident when by all rules we
should have fled in terror—as happened once when
we were at war with the Chinese, and were made the
subject of a demonstration by a number of military
acrobats, whose proceedings might truly have discon-
certed our army had we not known beforehand that
the forces who head-over-heels advanced against us
threw no stink-pots‚ but somersaults only.

Of course it may be that the birds are nervous.
They may be yet so fiuttered by the volleys lately
fired into their flocks from shotted guns that they
will not stay to distinguish between appearances
and reality. And if they shall fly screaming east-
wards, Europe will laugh at the success of its fraud
—and, for me, ἶ will laugh with them. Only let us
not hear too much rejoicing of the righteous, nor
proclaim, as though it were to our credit, that we
never were for involving our country in an actual
war. If, however, our “demonstration'' be nothing
but a cunning stratagem‚ behind which is concealed
no honest determination to make a campaign or two,
then, should it succeed, Machiavelli has praised it
already by anticipation—which surely is justification
and honour enough.
