THE RED COAT

“Horse Guards, W.0., 25111 November 188o.—The
attention of the Field-Marshal Commanding in Chief
having upon several occasions been called to the fact
that officers quartered in garrison towns very rarely
appear in uniform, unless in the actual performance of
military duties, 1 have received his Royal Highness's
commands to request that you will be so good as to
point out to the staff and regimental officers serving in
the district under your command, that this custom‚
which has become too prevalent of late years, is not
in accordance with the spirit of the Queen's Regula-
tions and Orders for the Army, Section 12, par. 7, and
at the same time to enjoin upon them the propriety as
well as the necessity of their wearing uniform through-
out the day, except when engaged in recreations in-
consistent with its use.'’

[It seems almost time to appoint a Royal Commission to
inquire if any one has yet taken the slightest notice
of the above omen—December 1902.]

When Waterloo not yet was fought,
While Europe for the fray was arming,
The soldiers’ uniform was thought

By thern, and all thge1 maidens, charmilrig.
