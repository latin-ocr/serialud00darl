And we ?—with modest pride we learn
Our Union J ack they treat so ;

And smile the more with every turn ;
We’ve grown to love defeat so.

What's hunting, that a nation should
Have thought or care about it ?
’Neath any flag a peace is good,
But none the worse without it.

Then fly our standard as you please‚
Above the Dutch οι· undem

Or, lest-it tremble at a breem,
Its blazon tear asunder.
