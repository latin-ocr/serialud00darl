our opponents opinions which cannot be discovered
in anything they have said or written; and after
having for some time indulged myself in this course
of conduct, Ι questioned my confessor as to whether
it were right. He answered that it surely was so;
for, said he, we know well that what is spoken by
a candidate does very seldom represent his real be-
lief, and therefore to assume that his expressed views
are those he really holds were to do him deliberate
injustice3 but as to what he does not say, we may
attribute to him what we please of it as his meaning,
for we have no assurance that we do not then speak
his mind, although he himself would conceal it.
Fortified with these and other solutions of my
doubts, I fought and won my election. 1 had not
been long in Parliament‚ however, before 1 found my
conscience again in sad trouble, owing to the claims
made upon me by the leaders of my party. I ran at
once to him who had so enlightened me before, and
asked him how much Ι was bound to do of that
which my party demanded. You must do their will
in everything, said he3 sor, as a good man were a
bad Thug if, being of that sect, he should not commit
murder on occasion, so, if you set up, as Ι did not
expect you would, for doing only that you morally
approve, you are dishonest in preferring your own
applause to the discipline and objects of your party;
but be careful not to sell your independence without
getting the price of it into your pocket, or your con-
science will for that reproach you very justly.
