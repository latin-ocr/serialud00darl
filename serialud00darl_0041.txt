HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS

“The desire that your Commissioner should repait· to
tlze Metropolis in given circumstances need not in any
way bear the sense of what is commonly understood by
a recall.''—-Mr. Gladstone, in May 1885.

The work of Sir Peter Lumsden, and the other English
Commissioners for settling the question of the boundaries
of Afghanistan, was violently intersered with by the
Russian forces attacking the Afghans and occupying
Penjdeh. The brief chronicle of the time states bluntly
that Sir Peter Lumsden’s Commission was recalled by
order of Mr. Gladstone's Government.

Come, Stewart, haste away3
‘Tis the merry month of May,
And London bright as ever Heliopolis—
‘Tis the season to be gay,
There are pictures and the play3
I've a fancy to repair to the Metropolis.

Let us hurry to be off ;
For to wait on Komaroff
Is as dull as to abide in a Necropolis.
Though the Russians jeer and scofl‘,
Afghans dubiously cough,
I'm determined to repair to the Metropolis.
