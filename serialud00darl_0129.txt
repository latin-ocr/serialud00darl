you do not forget, and maybe even the suicides

cannot completely.

John Smith, not having had the chance to play a
leading part in the Comedy of Life, had chosen to sit
himself down a vacuo plausor theatro. So, the stage
being empty, he invented scenery to his taste‚ a plot
to accord, dramatis personae whom it was a pleasure
to meet3 and he found the days which never were as
real as those moments we call the past; while he
assui-ed me that, for the present, there is no such
thing.

“I choose,’' said he, “to imagine myself what Ι
never was, and live in times and places where 1 have
never been,

⁴ And there into delight my soul deceive.’ ''

1 sear me that John Smith has made but few con-
verts to his doctrine of cheap contentment; but since
he has never made any attempt to exclude another
from that sunlight-—which Constable has stayed for
him, as J oshua might, upon those Suffolk acres which
in Chancery he claims as his own—-I can look forward
to yet another lesson from him and hope to profit

by it.
