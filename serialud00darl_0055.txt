far along it when 1 saw by the wayside a man
dressed so vilely that I knew our officials, and not
his own taste, had chosen his clothing. “Come‚”
said 1, “here is the ‘poor person’ in the flesh, and
from himself will Ι discover what he is in the ab·

replied by pointing out to this rich man that he was
rich only for the instant. “The moment,” said he, “is
all. And you, sir, it seems to me, have no right to
