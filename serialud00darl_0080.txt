A BALLAD OF RESPONSIBILITY

“The Ministry have resolved to accept without re-
serve the responsibility os leaving the Irish Executive
to sace the difficulties of the situation in Ireland with-
out other resources than those of the ordinary law.
It is unfortunately too plain that outrages of the
most detestable kind are os daily occurrence, and that
terrorism unparalleled in recent times has been irn-
posed upon three out of four of the Irish counties. lt
is equally indisputable that the law is almost power-less
to prevent these crimes or to punish the criminals.”
—The Times, Nov. 1880.

Be happy, Irish landlords‚
Though your rents are never paid3
Murmur not, because by cut-throats
In the dark you are waylaid;
1f beleaguered in your halls‚
Be consoled to think that we
Quite admit that on us falls
The responsibility.

With your acres lying bare,
Not a coin in your purse,
Calm and confident attend
Fresh afflictions even worse.
So when on some starless night,
From your burning homes you flee,
You'll remember, with delight,

Our respongibility.
