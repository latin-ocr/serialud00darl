to find on the subject is one in which a man attempted
to escape the consequences of his own act by alleging
that his wife procured it.

Ladies who would mix in politics, bethink you!
Though you may not vote for a member of Parlia-
ment you are not condemned to silence. You may
express your views in “riots” and in “routs.” As
you may throw conferti in Rome, so may you heave
bricks in Banbury3 nor sear to suffer for it, provided
only—which may possibly detract from the fun-your
husbands be present. 1 trust no one will think it
absurd that a woman who is not afraid to face the
dangers of a riotous assemny, and the staves of
an exasperated police, should still be supposed to
tremble with sear of her husband while she bears
herself bravely in the battle ; and I would remind any
who object thus of the notorious power of discipline
to produce heroes.

An ingenious and learned person in coir and silk
has suggested to me that it is open to doubt whether,
even if a woman beat her husband, it must not be
presumed that she acts under his compulsion in so
doing3 for, from the necessity of the case, he is pre-
sent when she commits the offence. 1 own that to
my own judgment this appears somewhat unreason-
able, which we are assured the law never is. And,
although to hold this to be law would be to advance
one step only beyond the position we have reached,
yet we must here tread carefully3 for it is plain that
to hold suicide by a wife in the mere presence of her
husband, to be his act, and not hers, would again be
only one step further, though it mean a hanging for
him. Thus the last step may be as costly as that

notorious first one.
