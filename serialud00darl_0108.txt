lVIARTINUS SCRIBLERUS IN
IRELAND

The last sudden disappearance of the celebrated
Martinus Scriblerus was attributed — with what

world, uncertain or unknown; andin the introduction
to his writings we find his biographer saying :—“The
last time I heard from him was on occasion os his
strictures on the ‘ Dunciad'; since when, several years
being elapsed, Ι have reason to believe this excellent
person is either dead or carried by his vehement
thirst of knowledge into some remote, or perhaps
undiscovered, region of the world.'' Subsequent in-
vestigation has revealed to us that the great philo-
sopher, critic, and law reporter had betaken himself
to Ireland.

The writings os Martinus Scriblerus were, as the
learned are aware, scattered about the world under
the names of many authors, and those recovered are
stated, on the last page but one os the first book of
his published works, to have been discovered in a
