A REMONSTRANCE

The Birmingham Chicken to the Home Secretarv.

Sir William Harcourt has written to the magistrates,
calling their attention to “the epidemic of prize-fighting,”
and desiring them to cure it.

Why, Sir william, why so hard on us poor chaps
As does a little milling now and then ?

I've heard tell how in giving hardish raps
You're the neatest and most punishing of men.

Surely fighting can’t be now agin the laws!
Look at Ireland. Ain't they fighting over there ?
Yet, Sir William‚ that don’t trouble you two straWS,
Or you’d say to Mr. Forster, “See it fair.'’

When a dozen Irish blackguards set on one,
And batter him to death, as now we see,
Ain't it just that to 'em something should be done
— Ere you meddle with “The Nobby One '' and me?

A prize-fighting epidemic—so you say——
Is a-raging. Man to man we stand and fight.
Is that wrong because it is the English way;

When the sides are no ways even, is it right ?
