ΒΕΝΙ SOIT QUI lVIAL Y PENSE

A song very popular between 1880 and 1886, but now
gone out of fashion.

What is our flag, that we should make
So rare a fuss about it?

A tinted rag upon a stake3
We well might do without it.

Whene'er it fiies, where’er 'tis borne,
Some warlike gust will rend it;

Then bloodshed dyes the standard torn,
And 1 am taxed to mend it.

To live in peace, let honour slide—
To lapse, the statesman’s term is—
So wealth increase, the blush shall hide
Beneath his epidermis.

Should Russia claim the Isle of Wight,
Consult some foreign nation ;
Nor think it shame‚ though wrong or right,

To beg for arbitrzsstion.
