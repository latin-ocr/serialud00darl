A RADICAL RIME

Oh, what can we do for the Boers ?

Now our troops they have slaughtered by scores,
We admit that their treason
Has excellent reason3

So England their mercy implores.

Independence we'll give them, of course,
Since they threaten to take it by force ;
For there's nothing so wrong
As oppressing the strong;
’Tis a sin that brings endless remorse.

It is not that fighting we shirk—
We preserve all our taste for such work;
But when wrong, with contriti0n‚
We make “ proud submission '’ 3
What a charming phrase ! borrowed from Burke.

Then we'll leave unavenged in their graves
Our soldiers-more slaughter it saves-
An indemnity pay
To the Boers, nor betray
An offensive regard for their slaves.

For the Boers' love of freedom is such
That the slightest control is too much ;
And all must agree
That a man is not free

If he may not keep slavezs, say the Dutch.
