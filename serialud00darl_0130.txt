CARPE AETERNITATEM

Again live o’er each happier hour long fied,

These may'st thou keep, though counted with the past ;
Whilst yet thy memory backward thou can’st cast,
Return ; and move amongst the friendly dead.

Cling to this day—the point beneath thy feet—
That slides, refusing aye thy step to bear,

As slipping sand, or never constant air;

Taste of each stream that glides the rest to meet.

Extend thine hand toward the time to be,

In fancy live the day that may not dawn ;
Nor, fearful, on the future trembling fawn ;
So shalt thou have beyond what eye may see.

Thus shall thy life be full through every space;
No Epicure’s, nor Ankret’s‚ selfish waste
Of sels in sloth, or yet more greedy haste.

Till thy glad soul shall reach her last abiding-place.
