Pray does Suzerain mean Sovereign ? when they ask me, Ι reply,
With its meaning Ι have nothing now to do ;

We chose the name advisedly. Ι cannot tell you why;
1f 1 did, perchance I mightn't tell you true.

It may signify the hoisting of our flag upon a pole;
Yet, perhaps, foretells the hauling of it down3

But, howe'er that be, it has a handsome sound upon the wh01e3
And it signifies‚ at least, a half a Crown.

Of peace I’ll sing the victor-ies, how cheap they are and good ;
How defeat is really conquest, 1‘11 explain ;

And elucidate the truth—as yet too little understood—
That to lose is but a better way to gain.

Ι will institute an Order of the Empire I have won,
Though the Quakers of my Cabinet demur3

Pale as sear shall be its ribbon, and its star a setting sun,
With, for motto, Tout est gagne—fors 1 ’honneun
