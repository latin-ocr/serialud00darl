EX UNO DISCE OMNES

“ Two or three nights ago a potato was dug up in a
cottage garden which weighed 1 lb. 5 oz., and the root
was in perfect condition. Any one who is accustomed
to these things will know what sort of a season it is if
this is generally the case.”—Mr. Gladstone at Leeds.

Potatoes weighed they one pound five—
If every root were healthy—

Our agriculture then would thrive,
And farming men grow wealthy.

Were beans to grow as large as figs—
Should every pod hold twenty-—

There were enough to seed the pigs
Yet leave the ploughman plenty.

Then, if the wheat grew high as oaks,
And peas as large as pumpkins,

I think that quite the richest folks
Would be our country bumpkins.

While, if each wheat-ear weighed a pound—
And there were just as many—
The penny bun, it would be found,

Would sell at ten a penny.
