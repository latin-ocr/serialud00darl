but he had lived under a warmer sky than most of
our poets before him. He calls the occupation of
doing nothing—we mean what the unintelligent, in-
dustrious world calls doing nothing—by its older,
gentler, and more feeling name. True it is that
he does but make allusion, in passing on to ruder
subjects, to that

¹ . . calm languour, which though to the eye
Idlesse it seem, hath its morality.”

Most English people, unhappily, will not perceive
the morality of this sublime idlesse; but the poor
negro, who splits a great gourd and seats himself
in one half of it, while the other half inverted pro-
tects his curly head—that moist hemisphere the
only object in a direct line between himself and the
too fervent sun, which is the cause of activity and
idleness alike—the negro knows the virtue and
wisely feels the delights of soothing idlesse. The
preacher will not praise him; but will rather bid
him arise and make sugar, and of that rum, to warrn
others in the frigid zone, instead of cooling himself
in the torrid one. But it is permitted to us-so
much has our language been distorted—to say
that if it is idle of the negro to sit vacant, de-
tached, and separated alike from the vicissitudes
of heaven and earth by the insulating halves of a
gourd, it is no less idle in the preacher to exhort
him to toil.

Yet true idlesse cannot be compassed by the mere
cessation from work, useful, useless, or destructive.
The operative on strike may indeed be idle—he often
is so even when nominally at work—but it is not

given to him to taste of the pleasures of idleness;
