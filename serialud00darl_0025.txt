A LAlVIENT

Spoken across the House of Commons

L1BERAL ΜΡ.

Join thy lament to mine,
Foe though thou art3
For the same ease we pine,
Though kept apart
By clubs‚ and politics‚
Caucus and party tricks,
Sportsmen‚ in sport we mix—
Friends we at heart.

CONSERVATIVE ΜΡ.

What joyous days were those
That once we knew,

When both the Houses rose
Ere grouse were due.

Now ‘co these bunglers we

Victims must offered be,

Nor moor nor stubble see

All autumn through.
