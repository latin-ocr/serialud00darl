Then coats were laced and hats were cocked,
Then pantaloons were strapped so tightly
The merest wrinkle would have shocked
A regiment that dressed politely.

A looser age—in dress, at least—

To that our grandsires knew succeeded;
And now the gaily garbed is priest,

While Guardsmen corne and go unheeded.

It seems almost as long ago

As those now distant wars, the Punic,
Since we an officer might know

By sword and spurs‚ pelisse or tunic.

Perhaps 'twas well they should not wall<
Abroad‚ in regimental trapping,

Who would not of Jomini talk,
Nor Vauban read, nor study sapping.

But times have lately changed again ;
Now sub-lientenants lightly prattle
Os Moltke, Marlbro', Prince Eugene,

Of sap and siege, and plans of battle.
