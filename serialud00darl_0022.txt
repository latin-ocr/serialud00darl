The song-birds from the woods have flown
Since Pamphila met Corydon;

She treads the trim parterre alone,
A little frown her forehead on.
Her name no more the breezes bear;
The fields grow green without her;
The rushing stream has ceased to care
A single rush about her.

Should Corydon again propose,
She‘d with delays amuse him ;

Yet comes he not—perchance he knows
She hardly might refuse him.
