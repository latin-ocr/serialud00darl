IRISH VAGRANT.

Ah! that’s a trick my tenants you have well taught.
But on my lands 1 had an ancient mortgage3
Rents 1 received none; so the gombeen man

F orced a foreclosure.

Now 1, a landlord by the Jews evicted,

Wander a—hunger’d, homeless, by the roadside3

While in the houses Ι myself have built them
Rent-free my hinds live.

[Exit Irish Secretary, smiling. .
