is disclosed by the stature or number of the footmen
who follow him. So superiority of right, to take
another instance, is not proved whenever a band of
brigands make a demonstration before a traveller3
and the wayfarer even knows well-as 1 trust the
Sultan does not—that mere concert proves nothing
but a common hostility for the time being, and does
in no way connote a mutual friendship.

Suppose the Porte to turn logician, and to formu-
late in a State paper to be communicated to the
Powers the matters proved to demonstration by the
fleets of Europe, the proposition would stand some-
what thus :—

English and French ships and seamen have be-
fore now destroyed one another, as at Camperdown,
Trafalgar, and elsewhere ; Italian and Austrian navies
have met in fatal conflict‚ as at Lissa. Russian and
English sailors were opposed before Sebastopol,
where, had not the ships of Muscovy dived like her
ducks, the English had surely taken them. Where-
fore it hath been argued that these several nations
cannot agree together on the water. Yet here are
representatives of all these navies collected into a
fleet and sailing together; and among them all is,
it is said, one little German ship of war. This then
proves that the fights of Trafalgar, Lissa, and Sebas-
topol are not to be renewed this aftern00n3 and,
moreover, that, like Alsace and Lorraine, certain
milliards are not carried on board the German gun-
bdat. Q.E.D.

This is everything that the congregation of flag-
ships which we have been told to expect will in logie
demonstrate; yet one would like again to ask our

Government—though they7certainly would make no
