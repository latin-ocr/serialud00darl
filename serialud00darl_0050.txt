THE BOLD LORD JUSTICE

“1 do not dissent->it would be unreasonable in me to do so,
as my brothers are agreed; but 1 must say that if1 had tried
the case 1 should have felt no difficulty about it. 1 do not
care a fig for the verdict of the jury in such a case.'‘—Per
Bramwell, L. J., in Wilkes v. The North-Eastern Railway
Company. Fiam and Mam’sty, JJ.‚ and ,lames and Brett,
L-JJ„ agreed with the verdict of the jury.

The palladium os the liberties of Britain, as the Press
Call twelve judges who have never worn a wig,

Will always, if permitted, railway companies oppress;
But their verdict I don’t value at a fig!

justice Manisty, you tell me, with their finding does agree-—
Legal luminary he, though rather dim—

His judgrnent joined to theirs will have but little weight with me.
No! 1 really do not care a fig for him!

Still, another J udge upholds him in the judgment that he gives.
Do you think to that opinion I will yield Ρ

No! Ι have as much respect sor him as any one who lives,
But yet, 1 do not care a fig for F ield!

Then there’s my learned brother who is sitting by my side3
He also would allow the plaintiffs claims.
1 don‘t desire this Court in any manner to divide;

But, I must say, 1 don’t care a fig for James!
