thing which we may be either praised or blamed
for. The man indolent—not suffering—will not, the
Epicureans teach, give a shilling in charity; for he
needs not to purchase contentment, since he has no
present lack of it. To go and succour the wretched,
or relieve the needy‚ will be the act os him who is
sensitive to the pain which others endure; and he
who feels any ache, be it in his own tooth or
another's, is not indolent. Yet though to be in-

nervous system—for the world is full of troubles—
why should we blame him who happens to be so
constituted as not to feel at all those blows when
they fall upon others, which he perhaps would not
greatly notice were they to happen on his own
shoulders? It is not true to say, “Nous avons
tous assez de force ροιιι· supportet· les maux d’autrui. ’³
There are some so weak that wrongs ten centuries
old importune them to weep. Surely it is hard that
indolence, which denotes only a state of being, like
whiteness or smoothness‚ the negation of darkness
and of rugosity—that the absence of anguish, the
presence of comfort, should be turned into a quality,
and condemned for a bad one.

It must be questioned whether perfect indolence
is compatible with the doing of anything whatever

necessity of putting one leg before the other, or of
turning on to his left side when he has lain long
enough on his right, must, it would seem, expe-
rience some slight discomfort in the position he
would change for another one. Any act whatever

must properly be regarded as a preparation for in-
