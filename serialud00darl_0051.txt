Still, my other learned colleague holds the jury in the right;
So again with opposition 1 am met;

1 am not prepared to differ, as 1 said—that is, not quite—
Yet I do not care, not 1, a fig for Brett!

Petty jurymen may loathe me for the language that Ι use ;
Leading articles my candour may condemn;

Half the newspapers of England my outspokenness abuse;
A Lord justice need not care a fig for them!
