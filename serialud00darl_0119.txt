We‘ll an abject apology write,

Such as Gladstone knows how to indite3
Then go down on our knees
In the dirt, if they please,

In a penitent’s garment of white.

Mea culpa, old Englancl shall say;

For an amnesty heartily pray3
Flagellated and shriven,
Confessed, half-forgiven,

From the Cape she shall hasten away.

Of Cronje we’ll make a C.B.‚

And Joubert a K.C.M.G. ;
While it’s well understood

We shall hang General Wood‚
If with Kruger he fail to agree.
