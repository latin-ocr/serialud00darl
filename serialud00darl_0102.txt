My confessor congratulated me on the intelligence
I had shown, in at once perceiving the necessities of
any method for expressing in our Statutes the will
of the majority of the day. But, said he, it is to be
observed that laws have never yet been made in this
manner; and, had all men waited till most were
agreed what law to make, it is more than probable
that in all the world we should not yet have made one.

He then went on to remark—with some levity, as
1 thought—that the meddling of everybody in the

business of legislation is not by any means an un-
mixed evil : for that we have already enough of laWS‚

and need only a few more constables to make us obey
them. He even—I know not if seriously-commended
the French—since‚ said he, you have introduced their
name—for lately unearthing certain old decrees and
going to work with them, rather than waste time in
discussing whether new Statutes should be passed3
and said that a few clerks would find, ready made
amongst the laws which by reason of our sorgetsul-
ness only we call obsolete, such weapons as would
serve our Executive for years to come and give our
Houses the holiday they ever long sor.
