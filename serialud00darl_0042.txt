Let us run and let us ride;
Turning not a step aside

To inspect a Coliseum οι· Acropolis.
London is too oft decried ;
'Tis a pleasure and a pride

Alike when we repair to the Metropolis.

Gladstone hopes we're on the road ;
See, he writes from his abode
In the town his Attic wit names “ MegalopoliS‚”
“To relieve me of a load‚
Try my euphemistic mode
Of scuttling‚ called repair to the Metropolisff’.
