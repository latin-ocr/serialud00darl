his years, His manner was so gentle, the ex-
pression os his views so inclined to be apologetic,
that at first 1 took him to be a man who held, or had
lately held, high office in the State. There was about
him such an air of deference as one remarks in a
Lord justice or a Cabinet Minister.

When 1 came upon him he was regarding, with
a look at once critical and nostalgic, a well-known
picture by Constable. Had 1 not mentioned that we
were in the National Gallery? As Ι passed be-
hind him he turned with what 1 took for a slight
movement of impatience, merely that little which
almost every man feels for every other within his
v1ew.

“1 beg your pardon, sir,'' said I—for, having been
but little abroad, Ι am not without some trace of
good manners—“I sear that 1 have incommoded you,
and the light of London, had one the whole of it, is
but a efflat-oscuro.’‘

The little man raised his hat, thus misleading me
further into thinking him a person of some import-
ance, and replied in the softest voice 1 ever heard:
“On the contrary, I looked round to see who it might
be that added the charm of a moving shadow to this
landscape, and afforded me the pleasure of believing
myself not here, but there again, sir, in the Vale of
Dedham itself.''

“ 'Tis a shame,” said 1, “that they should vulgarise
Suffolk 3 yet Ι hear that one may now make the tour
of Constable’s country as easily as of the Holy Land,
and with the same guidance‚ and thus the Stour is
to-day no more sacred than the J ordan.''
