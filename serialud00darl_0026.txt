LIBERAL ΜΡ.

Gently though breezes are

Touching the stream,
Sadly 1 think how far

From truth my dream—
That 1, as erst, should roam
Where the grey waters foam,
And lordly trout bear home,

Or humble bream.

CONSERVATIVE ΜΡ.

What though the blackcock call
Me from the hill—

Partrfflge, and pheasant, all
Birds that we kin.

Ground game, of every class,

Idly the season pass ;

In wood, or heath, or grass,
Wandering at will.

LIBERAL ΜΡ.

Heedless my leaders, who
So us molest,
Threatening till Christmas to
Hold us opprest:
Scarce, since the Houses met
One night we've slept, and yet,
Day by day, less we get,

Of needful rest.
