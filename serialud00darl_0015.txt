IN PRAISE OF IDLENESS

Any one acquainted only with the literature and
not with the climate of our country would probably
wonder at the hard words used concerning the
mere ceasing from productive labour and a little
folding of the hands to slumber. We have got
into a habit of glorifying many of the things we do
merely because, in consequence of our inveterate
custom, it would be painful to us to cease from
them. Hardly any one in this eager air of ours
knows how to be idle; yet idleness is still de-
nounced as a vice we are not only capable of but
addicted to,

It is a missortune, and an injustice to our lan-
guage, that from the very nature of things the
term “idleness” has been ill defined by the indus—
trious. Of what use is it to search in the laborious
pages of the unresting Johnson for the definition
of an enjoyment which he could never have experi-
enced when he wrote? He who looks for a just
definition of idleness does but waste his time in a
vain expectati0n3 for none but the idle might give
it to us, and how shall such men compile lexicons?
Here and there a poet has had a suspicion of the
virtues of sheer idleness. Lord Byron, perhaps,

comes nearest to a right knowledge on this sinbject3
