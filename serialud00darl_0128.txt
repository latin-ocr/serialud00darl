his name was John Smith, and that he, very appropri-
ately, lived in Bloomsbury.

Then I knew that all my first impressions con-
cerning him were wrong. There was then no
eminent contemporary Smith, but only the progeniem
vittosiorem of Adam, Sydney, and some others; nor
has any man of mark lived in Bloomsbury since
Murray, who himself, as all know, is now “no more
than Tully or than Hyde.''

John Smith and I had occasion to see one another
many times after this, our first and casual meeting;
and I found him full of pleasant recollections—for, to
listen to him, surely no man had had a happier nor
more eventful life. Born, as he assured me, amid
scenes not less than Ashbourne itself romantic, he
was in the fields a rustic poet with Bloornfield; at
Eton, with Gladstone, a statesman; at Oxford, a
man of taste; at Cambridge, of learning; in Paris,
of pleasure; in Italy, of the Carbonari and the thou-
sand of Messina.

It was some time later that 1 discovered how Mr.
Smith had never in his life been twenty miles from
Covent Garden.

Ι learned, too, how these various tales of his had
led certain unimaginative persons to pursue the
little man because he offended in being rich without
property, and contented without having what passes
in the world for sufficient reason; and it was thus
that—no matter where—I became acquainted with
his simple method of being happy. True, his circum-
stances were miserable and never had been other.
Are yours so, what do you do but endeavour to
