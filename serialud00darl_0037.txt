THE FRENCHIVIAN TO THE HOVA

Until 1883 the Hovas occupied Madagascar3 now the French do.

Said the Frenchman to the Hova: 1 invite you to explain

Why you treat our great French nation with such coldness and
disdain.

'Tis unfriendly that you never dine clrez Bignon or Vefour.
Do not say your land is distant ; don’t allege you are too poor;

Did you love us, as you ought, then wretched trifles such as these
Would not hinder our rapproclzement. You would brave the stormy

seas,
You would borrow like the Sultan, like Americans would spend,
And when ruined seek protection from La France, your truest friend.
Yet you eye with cold suspicion all advances that we make,
And whenever we step forward you two footsteps backward take.
Can you wonder that such treatment tires our far too patient race,
Till we twist your neck to gaze into your long-averted face ?
We‘ll oppress you till you like us, we will thrash you till you love ;
For the chastisements of friendship are all other proofs above.
Your εητίΐὶέ, we'll win it with our blood—well mixed with yours—
Since the friendship won by fighting longer than amour endures.
Ᾱ 13 guerre, then ἔ 'Tis your interest to be slaughtered and subdued,
Until there remain a remnant with right principles imbued—
Hate of coast-lines too confining, hate of separating seas;
Reverence for the right of F renchrnen to make friends of whom
they please3
Love for France, the first inventor and improver of the plan
For the liberty of peoples and the brotherhood of man.
