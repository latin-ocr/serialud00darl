hours to a debate as to whether it were allowable,
and a privilege os Parliament‚ for some members to
assault others during the sitting of the House.

After much debate it was resolved that there was
indeed some such privilege; but to be exercised by
the whole House, acting in its corporate capacity,
through its Ροαεετά, or Serjeant-at-Arms. No
sooner had this official removed, and deposited in
the Buffet, the protagonist in this contest, than
some one proposed that the President should “re-
port progress,’' which the poor man—no progress
having been made for some months—seemed re-
luctant to do, until it was explained that progress
was used only in the parliamentary sense3 which I
was instructecl means proceeding to talk while dis-
posing of nothing. Thereupon was commenced a
discussion concerning the police force employed in
a certain portion of the dominion3 and on this sub—
ject it was said that—since the greater part of the
inhabitants of that district were engaged, or wished
to be, in the commission of acts forbidden by the
law—it was unjust in the Executive to employ force
to check pursuits which already suffered from the
disapproval of the Legislature‚ and the example of
the late worthy Prince was commended for the imi-
tation of the Government, the following verse being
cited from the memoir of him :—

“ Il faisait ses quatre repas
Dans son palais de chaume‚
Et sur un ane, pas-a-pas,
Parcourait son royaume.
Joyeux, simple et croyant le bien,
Pour toute garde il n‘avait rien
Qu'un chien.
Oh! oh! oh! oh! ahl ah! ah! ah!''
