Each barley-corn a glass, at least,
of beer would yield; moreover,

That potent parasite called yeast
Would sprout the size of clover.

Our sheep would walk through six-foot grass,
And stretch their necks to catch it—

Until, in time, ’twould come to pass
They too would grow to match it.

One mutton chop might then suffice
To seed a score of peasants:

No more would hunger prompt to vice——
To poaching hares and pheasants.

No paupers should we then maintain ;
Yet starved, as now, need none die—
It were the golden age again,
Mine own Juventus Mund1‘!

Then ye who think mankind to aid
With idle dreams, like Plato's,

Betake you rather to the spade—
Go ; plant some big potatoes.
