Round send the fiery cross—
Tow steeped in turpentine3

Britain shall learn her loss,
When, by the serpentine,

Nursemaids all lonely go,
Weeping and walking3

With them, in tart-ans, no
Highlander stalking.

If in the fight you lose
(Childers prevailing)

Kilts and your tartan trews—
Then be there wailing.

Sad then the pibroch sound;
Sadly your snuff take;

Pass the old whisky round—
More than enough take.

Sleep ! They oppress you ;
Knows slumber no sorrow3
Wake not to dress you
Like Saxons, to-morrow.
