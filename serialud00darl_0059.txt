A NEW REGIMEN OF HEALTH

“It is commonly believed that after all there is no better
auxiliary towards the enjoyment of health than hard work ;
and that is a condition, that is an assistance, towards the
preservation and improvement of their health which her
Majesty’s Government have enjoyed and are likely to enjoy
for some time to come.”-—Mr. Gladstone.

To keep yourself in health the way is plain :
Toil till you tire3 fatigued, commence again ;
Let every hour some harder task supply3

Live but to labour, and, for respite, die.

Should cares of government your time engage,
Work to make work, ancl longer toil with age.
Where'er content you find, this doctrine spread,
Who covets nothing in effect is dead ;

Stir sleeping dogs to howl about your ears ;

To run is wholesome, and he flies who fears.
Should home affairs no mighty tasks afford,
Unsheathe and brandish, sheathe unstained your sword.
If there be war abroad, work hard for peace3
This gained, let not your daily toils decrease,
But, lest dull sloth from peace and plenty breed,
Let civil strife to foreign wars succeed.
Where’er is treason, nought but want behold3
Small urchins flog; leave traitors uncontroll'd,
Until no longer they in ambush lurk,

But murder boldly—and so make more work.
So shall each labour crops of labour bring,

And fresh abuses, where you harvest, spring.
