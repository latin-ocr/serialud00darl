Ι must say that the last line of this quotation was,
by consentment of the whole House, exceedingly
well rendered, and many times repeated—in fact, it
has been calculated that some weeks of the present
session have been consumed in making noises of
that sort. It is supposed by many that aster a time
the garrison of that part of the realm of Yvetot of
which 1 have spoken will indeed be reduced to one
watch-dog‚ in conformity with ancient custom; and
that, when the licence to keep him shall have run
out in default of renewal‚ he too will be allowed to
expire—if he be not earlier lapidated.

Ι regret to say that there has arisen lately in
Yvetot a dispute between the two Chambers of the
Legislature because one of them has thrown out a
Bill recommended by the other. I have, indeed, heard
it said that the Lower House is at once so wise and
so faint-hearted that it never would have dared to
pass this measure but that it was confident os the
greater courage and independence of the Upper
House. Be this as it may, the Commons, as they
are called, profess to be very angry with the Peers
on account of this matter, and even threaten them
with extinction for performing the part allotted to
them by the constitution. 1 am informed, however,
by certain learned men here that these two assem-
blies of Lords and Commons did formerly meet in
the same chamber and deliberate together; and 1 am
told that the Peers, should the Commons attempt to
deprive them of their separate position by a resolu-
tion of their House, will once again walk into the
chamber they left long ago, and there record their
votes. For my own part, 1 have heard no objections

made to this course excegg that it would oblige one
