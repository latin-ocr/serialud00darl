For me, 1 am no friend to dangerous discussion, or
Ι would, by way of retort, go on to question the his-
tory of the coli as worn by serjeants-at-law. This, it is
said by some, represents the hood assumed to conceal
their tonsure by priests who, when nullus cIen‘cus nisi
causidIcus was the sule, came to practise in the courts
of law. It may be so; but the coit· would have hidden
just as well a lighter head-ornament; as it did when
Wamba the son of Witless went disguised in gown
and girdle. Wherefore Ι will not go about seriously
to confute the learned Serjeant, but will follow to the
next assize town the J ustices in Eyre.
