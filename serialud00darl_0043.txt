JUSTICES IN EYRE

1

They journey merrily who leave sorrow behind them,
if it be only the trouble of others. And this, at
least, do Her Majesty’s J ustices in Eyre. Slowly, in
the Sheriff's coach, they rumble out of the town,
their work done ; and nimbly, as they who run behind
the car of Juggernaut‚ do the Counsel who follow
them hasten after. And ever we carry with us, to
beguile our journey, books so filled with strange
quips and pleasantries that we must encase them in
leather of a sad hue, lest all the world should read
and fall a-laughing over the mysteries of our art.
Whoever should issue an edition of the laws of Eng-
land‚ gay in a Pompadour binding, would make more
laughter than ever did Rabelais or Cervantes. Yet
till this be done 1 fear not to mention that Black-
stone is a jest-book ; for the outside world will neither
believe me nor read him.

It is a common error to suppose that our law has
no sense of humour because, for the most part, the
Judges who expound it have none. I know not
whether it has always been the case that the Legis-
lature waS‚ as now, comic, leaving solemnity to the
Executive; but certain it is that the gravest magis-
trate among us cannot fail to divert a large audience
