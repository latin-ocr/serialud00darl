Does to fight sor half a sovereign make the sin,
Since to fight for half an acre isn’t wrong ?
Ain’t the land a prize—and richer than the tin-—

Isto him who wins it fighting it belong?

Still, if law's agin us, leave us to the Beak ;
Why go writing him to let us have it hot?

You’re too strong, or Mister F orster is too weak3
Let us slide, as he lets off that Irish lot.
