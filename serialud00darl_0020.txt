as the rightful owner and occupier of Leisure, thine
own domain-where thou dost permit and welcome
us to stray. If thou appointest there no tasks for us,
thy “Fays ce que vouldras” is yet a command not
to go wholly unemployed; for at least we must live
—-and should we do no more, have not we there an
occupation sufficient to engage all the attention of
most of us for a lifetirne.
