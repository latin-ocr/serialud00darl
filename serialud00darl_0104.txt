It should never complain though you lie like a Greek—
It should whisper no pious behest,

If when one thing you think, you the opposite speak,
But sit mute in the statesmanlike breast.

A man‘s conscience is not, as you've hitherto thought,
A possession to prize and to keep ;

It is made to be changed, to be sold, to be bought,
To be soothed into torpor and sleep.

Let the moralists prose about goodness and grace ;
I admit all they say to be true ;

Still who keeps but one conscience must hunger for place ;
So the wise man allows himself two.
