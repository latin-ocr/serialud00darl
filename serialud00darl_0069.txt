ULYSSES ΟΝ Α STEAMBOAT

Mr. Gladstone was, in September 1880, on a cruise off the
coast of Ireland. He was credited with the intention of

studying the facts of the Irish question through a telescope.

Ulvsses-of Downing Street‚ not of Ithaca—by chance approaches in
his ship a certain island surrounded by a melancholy ocean, and
hears this songx with what effect upon his future conduct is as yet
unknown :—

Oh, help us this green little isle to secure,
Where potatoes are plenty and whisky is pure ;
Where the rent-seeking bailiff himself, as he drops
To our gun, leaves his bones for enriching our crops 3
Where riot and battle
And rapine a trade is,
And hamstringing cattle
The pastime of ladies ;
Where theft stands for honesty, begging for labour,
And religion means hating and stoning your neighbour.

Here grant we may live at our ease on the gold
We shall get when our landlords’ broad acres are sold,
While you neutral remain in the war we have planned
For shooting the buyers ancl keeping the land :
As a people we feel
For such fetters unfit;
So all laws we'll repeal‚
And all taxes remit.
While—the Union dissolved—we shall straightway advance
From “ Home Rule'' to “ No Rule'' in concert with France.
