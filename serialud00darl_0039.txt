THE CZAR’S COMPLINIENTS

The letter-carriers referred to, whilst waiting for an
answer, amused themselves by occupying Penjdeh.
Subsequent events have made the Duke’s joke iook

rather a poor one.

Politeness well a Prince becomes ;
Nor could the Czar do better

Than use his pen in Petersburg
To write a friendly letter.

A letter that the world might read—
Not all it says believing—

Such courteous note as Emir might
Feel honoured in receiving.

Good gospel lines, as oft men get
On whom is fortune frowning;

Such counsel as the safe ashore
May proffer to the drowning.

A stately sympathetic note,
Lamenting Eritish blindness
To Afghan merit: gracious words
Of compliment and kindness.

Some lines of sadness‚ some of cheer,
Of comfort and assurance3
A text to tell to suffering souls

The pleasures of endurance.
