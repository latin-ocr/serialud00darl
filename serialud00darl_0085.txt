demanded of my confessor whether it is allowable to
offer money to a voter as the price of his vote Ρ Ι was
answered that it is: because no man ought to vote
with no motive at all, but should exercise his judg-
ment3 and although the law forbids under penalties
the offering of a sovereign to a voter as a motive to
actuate him, yet there is no reason why the law should
be obeyed, if he who breaks it is prepared to solve
himself by payment. And it was instanced to me, by
way os example, that a certain association for the
gaining of seats had authorised the conveyance of
voters in circumstances where the law forbade it,
because only a money penalty followed the doing
of the prohibited act by one not an agent, but the
seat was not vacated. Observe, moreover, said my
confessor, that—as regards the moral quality of the
act—the nature of the penalty to be paid makes
no difference—-and indeed it is in morals better, as
being more heroic, to commit an offence which im-
perils your seat and your personal liberty, than
to confine yourself to such as touch merely your
pocket.

Then, said Ι, may we so extend this doctrine as to
allow ourselves to break any law we please, offering
to offended justice a certain sum, or something by
way of purchase money, douceur, or solanum Ρ YeS,
