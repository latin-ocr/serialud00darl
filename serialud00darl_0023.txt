Between an Irish Secretary, in tems, and an Irish

Vagrant‚ in rags.

ImSH SECRETARY.

Why do you sit there wretched by the roadside Ρ

Tell me your wrongs‚ and straight will 1 redress them.

Rich 1 can make you with ‘che rents of landlords ε
Forster my name is.

IRISH VAGRANT.

N ame that 1 well know. Pray, sir, don't repeat it.

You are the cause why wretched by the roadside

Ι must all day sit, and from night ‘till morning
Down in a ditch lie.

How can you so speak unto me, your best friend ?
Do not you know my “ Bill to cheat the landlords ” Ρ
Listen to ine, now; I have found a new way

How to pay old debts.
