One law, says Gladstone, yet remains 3
Though bars don't make a cage, or

Stone walls a gaol, the League in chains
Is legalised vis major.

Then Leaguers cry, You banish laws,
Or surely one might smash a

Thick head in this our holy cause
Nor fear a lettre de cache-t.

In Ireland thus they all explain—
And each with show of reason—
How laws permit, and eke restrain,

Both loyalty and treason.
