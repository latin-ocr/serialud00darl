THE REVERSAL OF THE FLAG

“The British ensign on the flagstaff in the market-
place at Pietermaritzburg has been reversed, and the
Transvaal flag hoisted above it, as a mark of defiance.
Another British flag was also trailed through the mud
in the streets.‘'—Standard.

Great news and glad, we hear at length3
The Boers so bold grow bolder;

Where Britain flies, they gather strength
And shoulder stand to shoulder.

They grasp the flag a thousand years
Have seen o'er freemen flutter ;

They tear it down; and no one sears
To trail it in the gutter.

Our late reverses to explain,
Or else, perchance‚ to dry it,

They haul it up its staff again ;
There upside down they fly it.

A neat and emblematic stroke,
Some deeper meaning hiding—
Of policies reversed it spoke,

Of power no moge abiding.
