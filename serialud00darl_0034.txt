was it dread of extinction‚ was it the inborn sense
of justice ?—consider well this verse of Dante :—

“ ‘ Figliu01 mio,' disse il Maestro cortese,
‘ Quelli che muoion nell' ira di Dio
Tutti convegnon qui d’ ogni paese :

E pronti sono a trapassar lo rio,

Che la divina guistizia gli sprona
Sl che la tema si volge in disio.‘ ''

Meanwhile Tommy hastens to reach the shore of
Acheron—and the gaps he left in the world and the
scaffold are closed again, from below.

It is nowadays less embarrassing than formerly
to attempt to serve two masters. They would seem
to have reconciled their conflicting interests by going
into partnership.

A century ago we learned, on the authority of a
comedian‚ that “ damns have had their day.'’ In some
Deaneries it would seem now to be held that damna-
tion itself is in the same sad case.

La ou il y a une religion etablie au profit de 1’Etat,

il me parait tres juste de punir les heretiques comme
des contrebandiers.
