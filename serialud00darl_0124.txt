os glaze, the sunlight seemed to linger. “ Those were
my father's fieIds, that one is the forty-acre piece,
and he lies there, behind that tower,” he said, with a
look that settled on a perpendicular grey streak in
the middle distance. “Somehow Ι shouldn’t care to
go there in a εὴειτεὲεῠεηεε, with a bugle.''

“N0‚” said Ι, “with whatever pretence at merri-
ment one may leave the paternal acres for one’s
regiment, or the Temple, or some approach to Down-
ing Street'’—and 1 watched for any movement to
betray to me the line of his advance in life—“it is
not in an omnibus that one would choose to return
to them.’'

“ By no means,” said he. “In a hearse, rather.’'
He smiled very slightly as he spoke, and standing
back a little from the picture, while he shaded his
eyes with his hands. “ Look, there is Dedham, and
here, to the left, is Langham—-over against it Higham
on the hill ; and there below it is Stratford, where we
caught the great pike‚ you and I”; and he indicated
a fleck of white which, contemplated from a little
distance, became the tumbling waters of a weir.

“ I had forgotten that,’‘ said I, desiring to be better
informed concerning the old gentleman‚ and therefore
affecting that ignorance which is the beginning os
all learning.

“Surely not,’' he continued. “The old pike, the
tyrant of the pool, who took the miller’s ducks as a
trout the May flies; who swallowed old Jackson’s
plummet when he was testing the depth for gudgeon,
and pulled down ,water-rats or srogs indifferently. 1
can see him now, as he lies among the weeds—and
there, too, is the miller.” And he bent a little closer

towards the picture. 98
