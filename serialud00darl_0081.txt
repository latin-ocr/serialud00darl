The police, you justly say,
Not a murderer can catch ;
And the rogues may live at large
Who do nought but treason hatch.
Yet though. civil war may rage‚
Have you not our guarantee
Tha‘c 'tis peace ; since we engage
Our responsibility.

Little comfort can you find—
Thus you mutter—in a phrase
Which, to those who live in sear,
No security conveys 3
It were better did it stand
For the rope and gallows-tree,
That expression, vaguely grand,
“ Our responsibility.’'

And, in fact, we must concede
That our meaning is but this:
Your unprofitable servants
You—if living—may dismiss
From the pay and pride of place :
So, in Council, we agree
You shall certain ruin face——
We, responsibility.
