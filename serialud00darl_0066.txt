definite answer—whether this is all that they intend
to prove, or whether they hope that the Turk, being
less perfect in his Euclid than in his Koran, will not
reason correctly upon the premisses before him, but
will foolishly conclude that St. Sophia is to be taken
by blue-jackets.

1f our rulers do indeed argue in this wise‚ we may
wonder how they can consent to so disingenuous an
artifice as that of attempting by means of a naval
uniform stuffed with straw and armed with a broom-

the harvest for the rats. To actually shoot crows or
men is a straightforward and unmistakable‚ if some-
what violent proceeding; but to make believe that
you are about to kill them, having all the while no
real intention of doing so, and that for the purpose
of influencing their conduct by unfounded sear, is in
the highest degree immoral, and does in the end
deservedly earn their contempt. What, then, should
be said of him who should admit with ambiguous
voice that the crows have done nothing worthy of
death, yet should none the less send out against
them a native hobgoblin in company with a foreign

should make false pretence of being about to exter-

fancy the crows will see the straw beneath the
cocked hat and plume, and may refuse to be scared
by a solemn concert of bogeys, to the discomfiture of

that ragged regiment. '1‘th we ourselves have done
