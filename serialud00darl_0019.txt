dolence rather than a part of it. Said the demon
of “The Castle of Indolence’' :—

“ But if a little exercise you chuse,
Some zest for ease, 'tis not forbidden here.‘'

The indolence of that castle was evidently mixed,
like that of all the world. How complete and ab·
solute indolence is compatible with the occurring of
the necessity for “some zest for ease,'' were difficult
to explain, except on the hypothesis that indolence
is like repletion, and wears off. This indolence, it
is plain, is, after all, but a sleepy pleasure, though
a perfect one. But idleness is of a more wakeful
sort. It was idlesse, and not real rounded indolence,
which Thomson described in the verse :—

“ Here nought but candour reigns,
Good-natur'd lounging, sauntering up and down ε
They who are pleased themselves must always please ;
Νοι· heed what haps in hamlet or in town ε
Thus, from the source of tender indolence,
With milky blood the heart is overflown,
Is sooth'd and swectened by the social sense ;
For interest, envy, pride, and strife are banish'd hence.”

From “the source of tender indolence’' then, we draw
idleness-—a better possession, though few there be
who know how to employ it.

Ah„ gentle Idlesse! how many rich and rare
gifts do not we owe to thee, which Industry—more
hurried in her walk, and more concerned to arrive
at her appointed field of work than with enriching
herself on the road thithersswhich Industry, Ι say,
had never stopped to gather for us! Condemn thee

who will, I will praise th5ee and acknowledge thee
