to the Courts. There the dispute still continued.
The Counsel had got the length of contending that
any one received into a workhouse is ipso facto a
“poor person‚” while the Judge seemed to think
no one a pauper who had any money in his pocket.
The action which gave rise to this contention was
for false imprisonment, the workhouse being the
place of incarceration.

Why, my learned friend, when you argued that
to be in a poorhouse is to be poor—why were you
not reminded that “stone walls do not a prison
make,'' nor brick ones a pauper? Cucullus non facit
monachum—and Charles V. at Yuste, was he not
always the Emperor we know of Ρ Your excuse is
in your position, for truly you could not, like me,
leave the Court and have the question resolved for
you by the roadside. Yet the judgments St. Louis
gave in open air were no worse than I have heard
In banco. If we cannot revert to sittings in that
simple fot-um, I for one will go study there now and
then, and will bring you back, as now, a note of what
1 hear decided.

Let us not again complain of the vague wording
of our Acts of Parliament, when we may invite the
legists of the hedgerows, who now would make our
laws, to do us the favour to interpret their doubtful
meaning.

As to this case, Ι believe the Judge solved it in the
‘sense understood by the vagrant.
