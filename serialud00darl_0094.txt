THE PLAID PROSCRIBED

In the course of Germanising the British Army it
was naturally argued by the Minister for War that,
if our soldiers all wore spikes on their heads and
trousers of a Teutonic fashion, they were likely to
win victories as startling as Sedan. The contern-
plated reform would doubtless have been carried
into effect, but that it was found more difficult to
get the Highland regiments to put on the breeches
than to take off their kilts.

Soldiers os Highland c1ans,
Childers contemns you-—

'right trews of black he plans ;
To thern condemns you.

Come then in philabegs,
Sporran, with claymore;

Shout—though your brawny legs
Silently say more.

Blow on the bagpipes loud
challenge to battle—
Fly shall the Saxon crowd,

Frighted as c'Vagtle.
