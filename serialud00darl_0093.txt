Make haste ‘co compose us a Speech from the Tru-one*
We our views would not lucidly state—

No phrases employ which are hard to disown 3
And don’t use that word “vindicate”

Begone! but to-morrow return at this hour,
And bring us a bundle of laws,

By our Parliament passed, for increasing the power
Of policemen—in Liberty's cause.
