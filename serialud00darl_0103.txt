THE EASY CONSCIENCE

“The official has two consciences. The original conscience
includes truthfulness, and a great many virtues which are not
included in the official conscience.''—Lord Rosebery.

How oft has the cynic ill-naturedly said
Politicians no conscience possess;

Yet Lord Rosebery’s friends have a couple per head,
And were useless if furnished with less.

They've an everyday conscience: a delicate thing
That shudders and shakes at a lie,

says the truth must be told though disaster it bring,
That 'tis worse to dissernble than die.

But what use, says his lordship, in office to me
Is a soul of such sensitive stuff?

A good conscience prepared sor imprinting should be,
, Like hot sealing-wax—plastic‚ but tough.

A good conscience official is something more rude
Than an unemployed sinner requires ;
It should most of the commonplace virtues exclude,

To give play for one’s7factious desires.
