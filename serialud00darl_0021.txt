A POEM OF A PAINTED PLATE

Pale Pamphila, of ruddy hair,
Had won the heart of Corydon3

He bathed in scent, put raiment rare—
In which he greatly gloried—on.

Through prim parterre and leafy grove
He sought until he found her,

’Mid trees that fell in love and strove
To wind their arms around her:

The woodbine held in fond caress
Her foot, that trod so lightly;

While ruder brambles hugged her dress,
And foxgloves bowed politely.

Though Pamphila inclined awhile
To hear the vows of Corydon,

Her red lips parted in a smile
Ere he had half his story done.

“ My heart,’' said she, “is not for you 3
Ι sigh that you must lose me3

You well might win it, but you Sue
While all in nature woos me :—

The bright brook loiters when 1 gaze3
To kiss me—there reflected—

The iris dips, the swallow plays:

So go your way, Γξῄεεϊεό ! ’'
