L'ESPRIT DES LOIS

In Ireland now they all complain—
And each with show of reason—
That laws permit, and laws restrain,

Both loyalty and treason :

There are no laws, the peasants say,
Save such as rule the breezes;

So each may go his chosen way
And do whate'er he pleases.

No law there is, the priesthood teach,
Save thine‚ divine expedience,—

This gospel only may one preach
And look for strict obedience.

Some laws, the landlords say, were meant
For beasts of chase. The same laws ·
Might save us, if the Government
Would put in force the Game Laws.

‘⁶ chacun pour sol, ” these make reply,
“ Et Ie bon Dieu ροιιι· tout. ’‘ So

Let each on his own gun rely,
And arm himself like Crusoe.
