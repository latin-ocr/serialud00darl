air where your enemy had, to his own detriment,
excluded everything but light3 and as to this same
light, had so discoloured and debased it by means
of blinds, shutters, and curtains that—but for your
bricks—he was in a fair way to lose his eyesight
and become as one of those fishes in the dark caves
of Kentucky.

Be that as it may, however, it is time to take up
again my story of the rioter and his wife. Know

described, by way of making the matter plain, as a
riotous one and a routous, 'they were clearly fit sub-

thrown bricks, each had been riotous and routous3
and yet he was convicted, and she was acquitted‚ for

of this defence, has repudiated obedience and insisted

on equality; while the earliest case 1 have been able
