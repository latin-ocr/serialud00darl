THE SUZERAINaQUEEN

“The word ‘suzerainty,' 1 believe, in modern times, is perfectly well
known in international law. It is undoubtedly quite distinct from
sovereignty‚ while it has marked relations to sovereignty. . . . 1
quoted ‘suzerainty’ because it is the word the Government have
advisedly used in their communications with the Boers, and which
will be incorporated in the settlernent.''—Mr. Gladstone.

In consequence of the defeat of a few hundred British on Majuba Hill
early in 1881, Sir Evelyn Wood was forced by the Government to
enter into the Convention which established those impossible relations
between British and Boers which have been brought to an end in the
recent annexation of the two Boer States.

You complain that 1 have been of forward policy the foe,
Nor have honours for our country ever sought3

Yet not Beaconsfield himself has such a diadem to show
As this Crown that 1 from Africa have brought.

He made our Queen the Empress of the Indies. What a name!
In such title no magnificence I see;

Of the Transvaal she, but yesterday, the Suzerain became;
The Suzerain ! Ah l that style she owes to me.

Yes ! she's Suzerain of the Transvaal. How I linger on the word ;
Little meaning, it appears to say so much ;

At St. J ames‘s, as at Birmingham, with pleasure 'twill be heard;
And with even more enjoyment by the Dutch.
