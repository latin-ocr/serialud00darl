of Thirty desires more earnestly than another it is
the frequent opportunity of sending a member to
Parliament.

They hold, said 1, that, like Antaeus, we of the
Commons are all the better for a fall to the earth
now and then: that, as some renew their forces in
baths of mud‚ so should we draw our strength from
that low social conche which Mr. Bright named the
“residuum’'; and therefore they are agreed that no
House of Commons should endure beyond one year,
which is just eleven months more of life than they
would allow to the House of Lorcls.

But if, said the, as this mandat assumes, the re-
presentative is simply to obey the orders of his con-
stituents or Caucus whenever he receives thern, there
should never henceforth be any dissolution, nor
general election3 for it would be sufficient then to
appoint deputies who should sit until death or dis-
obedience put an end to their deputyship.

To this 1 objected that in such case all debate in
Parliament were entirely useless; since no member
might vote according to his convictions, but only
upon the orders of his masters in that behalf.

My confessor inquired thereupon whether this
fact would introduce any change in our present
practice3 and 1 must admit that, remembering the
Whips and their ways, Ι had not at the moment any
answer to make him. I therefore contented myself
with pointing out that this system of a perpetual
Parliament instructed minutely by the body of the
electors would necessitate daily conferences of every-
body, and hourly ballots for members of Caucus to
instruct the deputy in the ever-varying wishes of the

crowd—which were impra7c'5icable.
